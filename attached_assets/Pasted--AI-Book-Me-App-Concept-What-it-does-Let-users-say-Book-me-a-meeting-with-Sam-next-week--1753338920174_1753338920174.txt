 AI “Book Me” App – Concept
💡 What it does:
Let users say:

“Book me a meeting with Sam next week,”
“I want a haircut Friday after lunch,” or
“Schedule dinner with Alex and Emma next weekend.”

The AI:

Parses intent using natural language

Checks your calendar (e.g., Outlook, Google Calendar)

Negotiates times, sends invites, or books the service

Remembers user preferences (e.g., prefers mornings on Fridays)
